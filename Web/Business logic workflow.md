##### Excessive trust in client-side controls
* Excessive trust in client-side controls
* 2FA broken logic
##### Failing to handle unconventional input
* HIgh-level logic vulnerability
* Low-level logic flaw (e.g. int overflow)
* Inconsistent handling of exceptional input
##### Trusted users won't always remain trustworthy
* Inconsistent security controls
##### Users won't always supply mandatory input
* Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint
* Password reset broken logic
##### Users won't always follow the intended sequence
* 2FA simple bypass
* Insufficient workflow validation
* Auth bypass via flawed state machine
##### Domain-specific flaws
* Flawed enforcement of business rules
* Infinite money logic flaw
##### Providing an encryption oracle
An attacker can use this input to encrypt arbitrary data using the correct algorithm and asymmetric key.
