#remediation 
##### Protect absolute URLs
When you have to use absolute URLs, you should require the current domain to be manually specified in a configuration file and refer to this value instead of the Host header. This approach would eliminate the threat of password reset poisoning, for example.

##### Validate the Host header
If you must use the Host header, make sure you validate it properly. This should involve checking it against a whitelist of permitted domains and rejecting or redirecting any requests for unrecognized hosts. You should consult the documentation of your framework for guidance on how to do this. For example, the Django framework provides the ALLOWED_HOSTS option in the settings file. This approach will reduce your exposure to Host header injection attacks.

##### Don't support Host override headers
It is also important to check that you do not support additional headers that may be used to construct these attacks, in particular X-Forwarded-Host. Remember that these may be supported by default.
##### Whitelist permitted domains
To prevent routing-based attacks on internal infrastructure, you should configure your load balancer or any reverse proxies to forward requests only to a whitelist of permitted domains.

##### Be careful with internal-only virtual hosts
When using virtual hosting, you should avoid hosting internal-only websites and applications on the same server as public-facing content. Otherwise, attackers may be able to access internal domains via Host header manipulation.
