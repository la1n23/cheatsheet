This behavior can be leveraged to steal the secret tokens required to reset arbitrary users' passwords and, ultimately, compromise their accounts. 

##### Web cache poisoning via the Host header

##### Exploiting classic server-side vulnerabilities like [[SQLi]]

##### Accessing restricted functionality [[IDOR]]

##### Accessing internal websites with virtual host brute-forcing

##### Routing based [[SSRF]]

##### Web cache poisoning via the Host header

##### Accessing restricted functionality

##### Connection state attacks
Server validates only first Host header.
**Example**: send two requests in sequence using single connection. The second request should have evil `Host` header.
##### SSRF via a malformed request line
