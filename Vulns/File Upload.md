Another common way to gain control over web applications is through uploading malicious scripts. If the web application has a file upload feature and does not properly validate the uploaded files, we may upload a malicious script (i.e., a `PHP` script), which will allow us to execute commands on the remote server.

Even though this is a basic vulnerability, many developers are not aware of these threats, so they do not properly check and validate uploaded files. Furthermore, some developers do perform checks and attempt to validate uploaded files, but these checks can often be bypassed, which would still allow us to upload malicious scripts.

For example, the WordPress Plugin `Responsive Thumbnail Slider 1.0` can be exploited to upload any arbitrary file, including malicious scripts, by uploading a file with a double extension (i.e. `shell.php.jpg`). There's even a [Metasploit Module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/wp_responsive_thumbnail_slider_upload/) that allows us to exploit this vulnerability easily.
