#### User Management

Users are often targeted as they are generally seen as the weakest link in an organization. The following user-related best practices will help improve the overall security of a WordPress site.
    Disable the standard admin user and create accounts with difficult to guess usernames
    Enforce strong passwords
    Enable and enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users
    Restrict users' access based on the concept of least privilege
    Periodically audit user rights and access. Remove any unused accounts or revoke access that is no longer needed


#### Configuration Management

Certain configuration changes can increase the overall security posture of a WordPress installation.
    Install a plugin that disallows user enumeration so an attacker cannot gather valid usernames to be used in a password spraying attack
    Limit login attempts to prevent password brute-forcing attacks
    Rename the wp-login.php login page or relocate it to make it either not accessible to the internet or only accessible by certain IP addresses
