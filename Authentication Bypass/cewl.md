```bash
cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
```

We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (-d), the minimum length of the word (-m), the storage of the found words in lowercase (--lowercase), as well as the file where we want to store the results (-w).
